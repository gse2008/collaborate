This is where out story is going to go 
once apon a time there were three rabbits that hated carrots, but loved cheese and yogurt. In their free time the rabbits enjoyed doing jumping jacks.
The three little rabits were very good friends, but sometimes, they would fight over a piece of cheese. Billy was usaually the one that started the fight while pop tried to keep the peace. Billy usually tried to steal the cheese to make hamburgers at night. Billy loved burgers, and when the opportunity he will always try find cheese for that burger. 
One time, Pop caught Billy trying to take his cheese!
"Give me back my cheese!" Pop screamed
while Billy laughed and ran away happy with his cheese
Pop watched Billy run away with the cheese and couldn't help but laugh
Apple watched from afar as the cheese was stolen, taking care to hide his few bits of cheese.
"Billy, you're a naughty little rat! You'll never get my cheese!" Apple thought
