This is where out story is going to go 
once apon a time there were three rabbits that hated carrots, but loved cheese and yogurt. In their free time the rabbits enjoyed doing jumping jacks.
The three little rabits were very good friends, but sometimes, they would fight over a piece of cheese. Billy was usaually the one that started the fight while pop tried to keep the peace.
